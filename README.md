# Odin Restaurant Page

This project is focused on learning and implementing **Webpack** to bundle and manage the assets, modules, and dependencies. The application includes various interactive sections such as home, menu, and about pages, along with features like a dynamic bag system and modals for order confirmation. The goal is to create a modular, maintainable, and responsive application while utilizing Webpack's powerful build tools.

- **Order Confirmation**: A modal system to notify users when their order is confirmed, with the option to refresh the page.
- **Content Loading**: Efficient handling of the home, menu, and about sections through modular functions.
